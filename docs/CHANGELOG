3.1.2 - 28 MAY 2012
* Fixed a bug in DEF FN recursive functions (thanks to Miguel Jodar).
* New default palette (mostly using code as data to free 64 bytes for the fix).
* Moved the UDGs next to the palette to create 22 user variables addressable
  via the IY register.
* Changed the COPY command to CALL.
* ZXC3 version excludes the DEF FN fix, and moves the cursor and font
  definitions, but is otherwise identical.


3.1.1 - 20 MAY 2012
* Fixed a bug where STR$ would remove the value of ATTRT. For example:
  PRINT PAPER 5;1;STR$ 234. All available space is now used.
* Added support for building a special version for ZXC3 cartridges for the
  Interface II.
* Revised version numbering to add another point. The were four builds of
  version 3.08. These are now retrospectively labelled 3.0.8 to 3.1.1. This
  brings OpenSE BASIC in line with GNU version numbering (major.minor.revision).

3.1.0
* Minor optimization.

3.0.9
* Applied a patch to support a commonly called routine. Should improve
  compatibility.
* Removed service routine at 4200. 9 bytes spare.

3.0.8
* Contents after REM no-longer tokenized. This was introduced a long time ago
  to support HiSoft BASIC, but there is no prospect of HiSoft BASIC working
  with OpenSE BASIC so there's really no need to tokenize after a REM.

3.0.7 - 29 APR 2012
* Fixed the bug in handling keywords beginning with IN introduced by the
  <=/<>/>= fix.
* INK is no longer available as an alternate command and CAT goes back to DIR.
* COPY 4200 fills the second display file with the permanent attribute.

3.0.6 - 23 APR 2012
* Fixed the tokenizer bug: <=, <>, >= are now handled correctly.
* EDIT with no parameters now edits the last line entered.

3.0.5 - 05 APR 2012
* Further optimization: 24 spare bytes.
* Cursor handling modified to deal with the removal of the EDIT key.
* Restored original palette for the time being due to anomalies with HSL
  hardware.
* Restored the Insert mode cursor from version 3.03.
* Reformatted the tabs for VisualStudio/TextWrangler.

3.0.4 - 14 FEB 2012
* Minor optimization
* New default palette for RGB or HSL modes in ULAplus
* Changed four commands DIR > CAT, GO SUB > GOSUB, GO TO > GOTO,
  ON ERR > ON ERROR
* Now uses CLUT 0 on boot
* EDIT key replaced with TAB key
* Insert mode cursor now uses character 128
* Cryptic credits changed

3.0.3 - 29 MAY 2011
* Fixed a bug in the DRAW command

3.0.2 - 24 MAY 2011
* Compiler changed to GNU binutils.
* Initialization routine now puts a copy of the default palette in the
  palette buffer.
* ERASE command now sets the palette to the values stored in the buffer.
* Corrected an error with the '_' glyph.

3.0.1 - 13 APR 2011
* Moved the UDGs up next to the system variables creating space for 64
  palette bytes after the attributes for use with ULAplus screen files. 

3.0.0 - 06 APR 2011
* Switched to using OPEN81.ASM as the base assembly file.
* Implemented the X80 math co-processor instruction set via macros.
* A complete rewrite replacing all the encumbered code with open source
  code or legally reverse engineered code where that was not available.
* Functionally compatible with SE Basic 2.21.
* New RENUM routine. It only accepts the first two parameters (start and
  step), but it isn't broken either.
* New tokenizer. You can now enter INK and it will automatically be
  translated to PEN. Abbreviations for 60 commands.
* New I-beam cursor for INSERT mode.

2.2.1 - 04 DEC 2010
* Fixed a bug where 8-bit character sets were being automatically enabled.
* Enabled support for IM2 code that uses the first two ROM bytes as part of
  a JP 0xAFFF instruction (used by Starstrike II).
* There is a bug in the colour handling during editing where entering a bad
  colour value will result in a syntax error report instead of producing
  the error cursor. This is caused by an incorrect guard condition on a
  jump but has no effect in runtime.
* Deprecated Features
 - macro support.
 - big colourful copyright message.
 - colour cursors.
 - built-in 42-column mode.
 - ANSI BASIC-78 command names. (later reinstated)
 - page up/down.
 - 8 extra symbol definitions.

2.1.9 - 01 NOV 2010

* Key click is off by default. POKE 23609 to enable.
* Modified the error sound code to prevent crashes caused by the
  detokenizer.

2.1.6 - 22 OCT 2010
* Relocated the UDGs to the former print buffer giving an additional 168
  bytes for BASIC programs.

2.1.5
* Syntax frozen with this release.
* Modified the CAT command to take parameters.
* Added the ERASE command to reset the default palette.

  feature.

2.1.3

* Added support for 8-bit character sets.
* Replaced unused bytes with RETs.

2.0.9 - 23 MAR 2010
* Fixed the PAUSE bug (thanks Woody!). The LastK flag (bit 5 of [23611]) is set
  prior to the PAUSE, prematurely ending the pause immediately. For example, FOR
  N = 1 TO 100 : NEXT N : PAUSE 0 (run, press a key. no pause). The ROM should
  clear bit 5, [23611] before the first test after the HALT.
* Moved some routines around.
* Replaced the 8 unused bytes in the main area with RETs.
* 9 spare continuous bytes left.

2.0.8 - 21 MAR 2010

* Built on a stripped version of the GW03 ROM (code but not the assembly
  listing) with all the new functionality removed and just the bug-fixes
  remaining.
* The 'style' bugs (not corrected in GW03) were fixed.
* Floating point and other optimisations from the SC01 ROM were applied.
* Code was merged, one routine at a time, into the Uncommented Spectrum ROM
  Assembly, and tested with the Interface I (this relies on many entry
  points being maintained and is a good acid test).
* The source was cross-compiled with Pasmo by Julian Albo and the resulting
  code tested on Fuse (by Philip Kendall et. al.) and the ULAplus code
  tested in SpecEmu (by Woody).

  bug in DELETE.

  26 bytes.

* Added LOAD, CODE and RUN tokens on Q, W and E keys with symbol shift.

  Enables use of reserved words as variable names. Variable names are case
  insensitive and can be entered in a mixture of letters in this mode,
  providing they contain at least one lowecase letter.
* Restored IM2 vectors at 0x38ff, 0x39ff, 0x3aff, and 0x3bff.
